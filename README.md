# PhilipsAirfryer
Python code I wrote to interact with my Philips 5000XXL Airfryer

I am not responsible for any damage caused by this program. For safe useage I recommend sending temperatures within the range of the device, and having the seconds parameter always be a multiple of 60.

Basics based on https://github.com/noxhirsch/Pyscript-Philips-Airfryer
